# Downly - Dependency Resolution and Error Handling Improvements

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve the dependency issues that caused Downly to fail on machines without pre-installed dependencies.

## Root Cause Analysis

The original issue was that the application would give an error code immediately when attempting to download on machines that didn't have ffmpeg and yt-dlp dependencies already installed. This happened because:

1. **Insufficient Runtime Dependencies**: The PyInstaller bundle was missing some essential Windows runtime libraries that the bundled executables (ffmpeg.exe and yt-dlp.exe) required.

2. **Poor Error Handling**: When dependencies failed to execute, the error messages were cryptic and didn't help identify the root cause.

3. **Late Validation**: Dependency validation only occurred when starting a download, making it difficult to diagnose issues.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced PyInstaller Configuration

**File**: `downly.spec`

- **Runtime Dependencies**: Added automatic detection and inclusion of Visual C++ Redistributable DLLs:
  - `msvcp140.dll`
  - `vcruntime140.dll` 
  - `vcruntime140_1.dll`
  - Various Windows API DLLs (`api-ms-win-crt-*.dll`)

- **Improved Binary Bundling**: Enhanced the binary inclusion logic to ensure both ffmpeg.exe and yt-dlp.exe are properly bundled into the `_internal` directory.

### 2. Comprehensive Dependency Validation

**File**: `src/downly.py`

- **Startup Validation**: Added `validate_dependencies()` function that runs when the application starts, before the GUI appears.

- **Executable Testing**: Instead of just checking if files exist, the validation now actually attempts to run each executable with version checks to ensure they work properly.

- **Detailed Error Messages**: Improved error reporting to show specific issues and suggest solutions (e.g., installing Visual C++ Redistributable).

### 3. Improved Error Handling

- **Enhanced Path Detection**: Fixed inconsistencies in how executable paths are validated between system PATH and bundled locations.

- **Better Subprocess Error Capture**: Enhanced error handling to capture and display stderr output from failed subprocess calls.

- **Timeout Protection**: Added timeout handling to prevent the application from hanging if executables fail to respond.

- **Process Cleanup**: Added proper cleanup of subprocess resources to prevent zombie processes.

### 4. User-Friendly Error Reporting

- **Early Error Detection**: Dependencies are validated at startup, showing a clear error dialog if issues are detected.

- **Actionable Error Messages**: Error messages now include specific details about what went wrong and suggestions for resolution.

- **Graceful Degradation**: The application provides clear feedback instead of silent failures or cryptic error codes.

## Key Functions Added/Modified

### New Functions:
- `validate_dependencies()`: Comprehensive dependency validation with detailed error reporting

### Modified Functions:
- `get_ffmpeg_path()`: Enhanced path detection logic
- `get_ytdlp_path()`: Enhanced path detection logic  
- `download_worker()`: Simplified since validation now happens at startup
- Application startup: Added dependency validation before GUI initialization

## Testing and Validation

The improved application now:

1. **Validates dependencies at startup** and shows clear error messages if issues are detected
2. **Bundles necessary runtime libraries** to work on clean Windows systems
3. **Provides detailed error information** to help diagnose issues on problematic systems
4. **Gracefully handles edge cases** like missing files, permission issues, or corrupted executables

## Deployment Recommendations

1. **Test on Clean Systems**: Test the bundled application on systems without development tools or pre-installed dependencies.

2. **Include VC++ Redistributable**: Consider including a Visual C++ Redistributable installer with your application for systems that might be missing these libraries.

3. **Antivirus Considerations**: Some antivirus software may flag the bundled executables. Consider code signing the application and its dependencies.

4. **Error Reporting**: The enhanced error messages will help users and support staff quickly identify and resolve dependency issues.

## File Changes Made

- `src/downly.py`: Enhanced dependency validation and error handling
- `downly.spec`: Added runtime dependency detection and bundling
- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality

## Next Steps

1. Test the application on various Windows systems (different versions, with/without development tools)
2. Consider implementing automatic dependency installation or repair functionality
3. Monitor user feedback for any remaining dependency issues
4. Consider adding logging to capture detailed error information for support purposes

The application should now work reliably on clean Windows systems without requiring users to pre-install ffmpeg or yt-dlp dependencies.
